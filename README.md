# Weapon Skill Keys

Adds 2 keybinds: one for a mainhand and one for an off-hand weapon specific attack skill. 
Each keybind uses a skill depending on the currently equipped weapon.  
*Note: The mod does not add any new quick slots, the keybinds trigger the skills on their own.*

## Weapon skills
### Main hand weapon skills
- **One-Handed Axe**: Talus Cleaver
- **Two-Handed Axe**: Execution
- **Bow**: Evasion Shot
