# Weapon Skill Keys

Adds 2 keybinds: one for a mainhand and one for an off-hand weapon specific attack skill. Each keybind uses a skill depending on the currently equipped weapon.

## Weapon skills
### Main hand weapon skills
- **One-Handed Axe**: Talus Cleaver
- **Two-Handed Axe**: Execution
- **Bow**: Evasion Shot
- **One-Handed Mace**: Mace Infusion
- **Two-Handed Mace**: Juggernaut
- **Polearm**: Moon Swipe
- **Spear**: Simeon's Gambit
- **One-Handed Sword**: Puncture
- **Two-Handed Sword**: Pommel Counter
- **Gauntlet**: Prismatic Flurry 

### Off-hand weapon skills
- **Chakram**: Chakram Pierce
- **Dagger**: Dagger Slash
- **Pistol**: Fire / Reload
- **Shield**: Shield Charge

Using the off-hand skill button with a **Lexicon** or **Lantern** equipped has no effect.  
*Note: You still have to learn the skill before you can use it.*

## Planned Features
- Hold off-hand button to reload pistol (to prevent accidental reload in the middle of combat)
- Potentially include Weapon Master skills
- Show status of the currently equipped weapon's skill (learned, cooldown, enough stamina/mana)
